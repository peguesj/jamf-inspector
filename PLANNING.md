## Overview
This project aims to deliver a responsive, highly interactive dashboard for Jamf Pro administrators, enabling:
- Data gathering and analysis via Jamf Pro API
- Identification and remediation of duplicate/conflicting/unused policies & profiles
- Grouping, refactoring, and pilot group assignment
- Approval workflows and scheduling
- Chat-based AI assistant for diagnostics, reporting, and feedback

## Architecture

    A[Jamf Pro API] --> B[Backend Service]
    B --> C[Dashboard UI]
    B --> D[AI Assistant]
    C <--> D
    C --> E[User Feedback]
    C --> F[Approval Workflow]
    C --> G[Pilot Group Management]
```

## Key Features
- Jamf Pro API integration
- Policy/profile analysis (duplicate, conflict, unused)
- Refactoring and remediation tools
- Pilot group creation and management
- Approval and scheduling workflows
- Chat interface with AI assistant
- Responsive, accessible UI/UX (drag-and-drop, filters, tags, animations)

## Dependencies
- Jamf Pro API access
- jQuery, drag-and-drop JS libs, CSS frameworks
- Authentication (Jamf API user)
- Node.js/Express (suggested backend)
- React/Vue/Angular (suggested frontend)

## Best Practices
- Align with ITIL/ITAM for lifecycle management
- Use Jamf Pro API efficiently (rate limits, pagination)
- Ensure security (API credentials, HTTPS)
- Maintain version control and documentation
- Reference official docs and standards
- Always verify fixes and solutions with authoritative online resources before applying (e.g., MDN, official docs)
- For every fix, outline the problem, diagnosis steps, method of resolution, authoritative reference, and steps taken
- In recursive processes, provide insights for reducing attempts (e.g., note deprecated commands, recommend alternatives, enforce stricter verification)

## Visual Aids
- Mermaid diagrams for architecture and workflows
- PlantUML for complex process flows

## Documentation Standards
- Version control comments at file top
- Inline commentary for support and future development
- Reference links and anchors

## Next Steps
1. Define API endpoints and data models
2. Integrate iterative development process:
   - At each iteration, batch feasible changes for efficiency while upholding standards
   - After each change, document learnings, problems, diagnosis, fix, and reference
   - Continuously update best practices and planning docs with new learnings
   - Enforce self-learning and process improvement as governing principles
   - Policies: /JSSResource/policies
   - Configuration Profiles: /JSSResource/osxconfigurationprofiles
   - Patch Management: /JSSResource/patches
   - Directory Connections: /JSSResource/ldapservers
   - Groups: /JSSResource/computergroups
   - Users: /JSSResource/users
   - Devices: /JSSResource/computers
   - Categories: /JSSResource/categories
   - Smart/Static Groups: /JSSResource/computergroups
   - Approval Workflow: /api/v1/approval
   - Feedback: /api/v1/feedback

   ### Data Models (Example)
   - Policy: { id, name, scope, category, enabled, triggers, payloads }
   - Profile: { id, name, scope, category, payloads, conflicts }
   - Patch: { id, name, version, status, devices }
   - Group: { id, name, type, members }
   - User: { id, username, groups, devices }
   - Device: { id, name, serial, group, policies, profiles }
   - Approval: { id, item, status, approvers, schedule }
   - Feedback: { id, user, item, comments, rating }

2. Design UI wireframes and workflows
   - Dashboard: Overview, analytics, quick actions
   - Policy/Profile Analyzer: List, filter, duplicate/conflict detection
   - Remediation Tools: Refactor, merge, delete, assign
   - Pilot Group Management: Create, assign, schedule
   - Approval Workflow: Request, approve, schedule, notify
   - Chat Assistant: Query, report, suggest, notify

   ### UI Wireframe (Mermaid)
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Dashboard] --> B[Policy/Profile Analyzer]
       A --> C[Pilot Group Management]
       A --> D[Approval Workflow]
       A --> E[Chat Assistant]
       B --> F[Remediation Tools]
       C --> G[Group Assignment]
       D --> H[Notifications]
   ```

   ### Workflow (PlantUML)
   ```plantuml
   @startuml
   start
   :Query Jamf API;
   :Analyze Data;
   :Detect Issues;
   :Suggest Remediation;
   :Assign to Pilot Group;
   :Request Approval;
   :Schedule Change;
   :Notify Users;
   :Collect Feedback;
   stop
   @enduml
   ```

3. Implement backend service for Jamf API integration
   - Use Node.js/Express for RESTful API proxy
   - Secure API credentials (env vars, vault)
   - Handle rate limits, pagination, error handling
   - Cache periodic queries for chat assistant
   - Log and audit all actions

4. Build frontend dashboard and chat assistant
   - Use React (recommended) for SPA
   - Integrate jQuery modules for drag-and-drop, filters
   - Use CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Bootstrap) for responsive UI
   - Implement accessibility (WCAG, ARIA)
   - Animate transitions and feedback

5. Test, document, and iterate
   - Unit/integration tests for backend and frontend
   - User acceptance testing (UAT) with pilot groups
   - Continuous documentation updates
   - Version control with detailed comments
   - Reference all standards and best practices

## Commentary & Best Practices
- All API endpoints and data models are based on Jamf Pro 10.44.1 schema ([API Reference](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-10.44.0/page/Jamf_Pro_Documentation.html)).
- UI/UX follows accessibility and responsive design standards.
- ITIL/ITAM alignment ensures lifecycle management and asset tracking.
- Security: API credentials must be protected, HTTPS enforced, audit logging enabled.
- Documentation: Inline comments, version control, and links to official resources for support and future development.
