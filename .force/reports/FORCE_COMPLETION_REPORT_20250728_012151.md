AutoGPT blocks and agent blocks have been copied to the new backend directory structure as requested. Directory mapping:

- backend/blocks/ (atomic blocks)
- backend/dev_sentinel/ (agent blocks)
- backend/force_agents/ (FORCE tool-calling agents)

Force components should now accept an input directory for the AutoGPT backend, e.g., backend/backend within autogpt_platform. If you need to update FORCE component definitions, specify the input directory as a parameter or config field.

Report generated after migration and structure update.
