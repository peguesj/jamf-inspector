# Supabase Project Implementation Plan

## Goal
Develop a robust Supabase backend using functional programming paradigms, strict typing, and TDD methodology. Support schema-driven type generation and API design with thorough automated testing ensuring >80% coverage with all tests passing.

## Approach

### Ordering
1. **Initialize Supabase project and configure base schemas.**
2. **Generate TypeScript (or target lang) types from DB schema.**
3. **Implement database migration scripts following naming standards.**
4. **Build CRUD API endpoints driven by schema and types.**
5. **Write unit and integration tests alongside implementations.**
6. **Refactor code for pure functional style and strict typing.**
7. **Setup automated test runners and coverage tools.**

### TDD Workflow
- Write failing test for each feature.
- Implement minimal code to pass.
- Refactor code for cleanliness and type safety.
- Repeat.

### Documentation and Best Practices
- Embed JSDoc and typedoc comments throughout.
- Use inline best practice commentary for functional idioms.
- Document API routes, schema contracts, and error handling.

### Quality Measures
- Target 80%+ coverage.
- CI integration for linting, testing, and coverage.
- Use FORCE validation for schema and code checks.

## Post-Implementation
- Proceed to frontend development upon successful backend validation.
- Use FORCE branch end tasks, atomic commit patterns, and documentation sync tools to finalize codebase.
- Use git workflows for iterative commits and reviews.

## Tools Integration
- Use FORCE tools suite to monitor code quality and project progress.
- Generate changelogs and automate release documentation.
