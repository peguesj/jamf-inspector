# FORCE Component Definition Scheme and Analysis for Vantage Portal

## Overview

This report encapsulates the analysis of the Vantage Portal project documentation to design a dynamic component schema eliminating static references in favor of a FORCE variant object-based architecture.

## Key Findings:

1. The project documents include nuanced roles (agents), hierarchical issues (epics, stories, tasks), telemetry, and integration processes.
2. Anchors are extensively used but represent static references which limit automation and dynamic linking.
3. Agents and issues with clear owners and priorities can be modelled as canonical FORCE components for unified project management.

## Proposed FORCE Component Schema

### Agents
- id: string (unique agent name)
- description: string
- responsibilities: string[]
- roleCategory: string
- relatedIssues: string[]

### Issues
- id: string (issue ID)
- title: string
- description: string
- ownerAgents: string[]
- priority: enum (High, Medium, Low)
- parentIssueId: string (to capture hierarchy)
- anchor: string
- type: enum (Epic, Story, Task)

### Telemetry and Integration
- metrics: definitions per agent and issue
- state contexts: Redis keys
- issue tracking: Linear links

## Eliminated Static References
- Replaced explicit Markdown anchors and file links with normalized component IDs and anchors.
- Adopted hierarchical parentLinking for issues as opposed to fixed anchor jumps.

## Next Actions
- Automate component creation from current documents.
- Integrate telemetry data tracking with defined metrics.
- Enable dynamic generation of issue status and assignment reports.
