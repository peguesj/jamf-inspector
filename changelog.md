# 2025-07-29 [api, models, docs, batch-update]
Batched update: All Jamf Pro Classic API resources and endpoints strictly typed and exported in /types/models.ts and /types/api.ts. Updated docs/AUTHORITATIVE.md and PLANNING.md to reflect full coverage. Version bump to v0.3. All Redux/UI logic must reference these authoritative types and endpoints. [GitHub Copilot]
# 2025-07-26 [backend] [build] [complete]
- Migrated backend and TypeScript build to strict ESM compatibility for Node.js v24+
- Updated all backend imports to use explicit `.js` extensions for runtime compatibility
- Replaced `__dirname` with ESM-compatible logic using `import.meta.url` and `fileURLToPath`
- Excluded all test files and frontend from backend build in `tsconfig.json`
- Confirmed backend serves frontend static build and API endpoints in a single-tier deployment
- Server now starts and serves at http://localhost:4000
- Minor ESM warning remains (can be silenced by adding `"type": "module"` to `package.json`)

# 2025-07-26 [process] [iteration] [in-progress]
- Iterative fix loop: build, serve, and verify backend/frontend integration
- Next: Document, polish, and prepare for further integration or UI/UX improvements

Jul 23 2025 14:37 jamf-inspector/frontend/components/ChatAssistant.tsx [ui, feature, type-fix]:
Fixed TypeScript errors by casting backend response data to expected types in ChatAssistant. Problem: 'unknown' not assignable to model types; Diagnosis: lint output and TypeScript docs; Reference: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions; Fix: used type assertions for Policy[], Profile[], Approval[], Feedback[].

Scaffolded strictly typed, stateless ChatAssistant component with backend integration for diagnostics, reporting, and feedback. Documented with JSDoc, referenced authoritative resources, and resolved strict typing issues. Added to learnings: implementation efficiency report definition, status tracking, and coverage drift chart.

Jul 23 2025 jamf-inspector/backend/index.ts [api, feature, batch-enhancement]:
Batched backend enhancements: added caching, audit logging, and strict error handling to all major Jamf API endpoints (profiles, patches, groups, users, devices, approval workflow, feedback). Documented with JSDoc and authoritative references. Problem: endpoints lacked caching/logging; Diagnosis: code review and planning docs; Reference: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cache, Jamf Pro docs; Fix: applied consistent caching, logging, error handling.
Jul 23 2025 jamf-inspector/backend/index.ts [api, feature, batch-enhancement]:
Added caching for periodic queries (node-cache), audit logging, and improved error handling for policies endpoint. Fixed TypeScript void return type for cached response. Problem: missing node-cache and type error; Diagnosis: lint output and TypeScript docs; Reference: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cache, https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/functions.html#void; Fix: installed node-cache, added explicit void return.
