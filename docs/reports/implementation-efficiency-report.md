## Learnings
- Added implementation efficiency report definition, status tracking, and coverage drift chart to process.
- Timestamp now includes time for rapid agent iteration.
- Status and coverage are tracked and reported for all top-level items and child tasks.
- All changes are documented in changelog and reports.
