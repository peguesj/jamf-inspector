## Authoritative Project Tracking & Dev Loop Process


---
### [2025-07-29] Batch rationale: Began API integration in roadmap order. Created strictly typed API client for Policies, integrated with Dashboard using react-query, removed placeholder logic, and updated PolicyList to use real data. All changes follow dev loop and standards. Status: Complete.

### [2025-07-29] Batch rationale: Integrated real API for Profiles in Dashboard. Created strictly typed API client, used react-query for data fetching, updated ProfileList to use fetched data, and updated error/loading handling. All changes follow dev loop and documentation standards. Status: Complete.

### [2025-07-29] Batch rationale: Integrated real API for Patches in Dashboard. Created strictly typed API client, used react-query for data fetching, updated PatchList to use fetched data, and updated error/loading handling. All changes follow dev loop and documentation standards. Status: Complete.

### [2025-07-29] Batch rationale: Batched API integration for Groups, Users, Devices, Approvals, and Feedback. Created strictly typed API clients, integrated with Dashboard using react-query, updated all list components, and improved error/loading handling. All changes follow dev loop, batching, and documentation standards. Status: Complete.

This file is the authoritative tracking document for all frontend work. All changes must follow the [Dev Loop](../.github/instructions/iterative-loop.logic.instructions.md) (formerly "iterative loop") as defined in the standards:

### Dev Loop Steps (with project-specific clarifications)
1. **Multi-Pass Reasoning**: Break down each feature into at least 4 passes, referencing planning docs, chat history, and standards. Example: For header, break into user info, status, reload, sparkle icon.
2. **Batching**: Group related changes (UI, config, logic) for efficiency. Document batch rationale in changelog and roadmap.
3. **Self-Learning**: After each batch, analyze what worked, what was missed (e.g., allowList updates), and update process/docs accordingly. Add explicit steps for recurring misses.
4. **Documentation**: Update roadmap, changelog, and standards after each batch. Add links/anchors to related instruction sets. Use #mcp_force-mcp-std_anchor_based_cross_referencing for cross-links.
5. **Process Recall**: Before each loop, review requirements, chat, and standards to ensure confidence in next steps.
6. **Loop Continuity**: Unless interrupted, always proceed in order. After error fix, resume batching or next pass.
7. **Error-Driven Fix Loop**: After each iteration, check for errors and enter fix loop if needed. Example: If theme is broken, fix before next batch.
8. **Atomic Commit Workflow (ACW)**: Stage, commit (multi-line message), create/switch to feature branch, push to origin. Log all actions in changelog and roadmap.

See [Iterative Loop Logic Instructions](../.github/instructions/iterative-loop.logic.instructions.md) for full process and flowchart.
